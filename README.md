# Classes
The classes listed below will be chosen in the matchmaking lobby before the game starts in a first come first serve selection. Each class must be chose for the game to start, and only one of each class is allowed per round. 
### Crane Operator
The crane operator sits above the other players in the crane and is in charge of collecting packed pallets from the forklift driver and moving them to the correct area for other player to collect. 
This classes challenge lies in the crane Controls. Moving the pallets requires a delicate touch, as items can be dropped or spilled in transit, causing a time consuming cleanup. 
The crane itself will only be operable by the Crane Operator class. The challenge of this class lies specifically in controlling the crane. I simple rope psyisics system wil be in place on the tow line, and controlling the vehicle will be done by a few different levers. Similar to stardew valley's fishing system, the operater will need to hold the button down to move the crane left/right. However, if you hold for too long it will have too much power. swing the load to quickly and you risking a drop.

## Iron worker
The iron worker is in charge of laying rebar at the base of each floor, as well as placing I beams where requested. This job, along with the mason, is heavily dependant on the carpenters scaffolding.

## Forklift Driver
The forklift drive is the first link in the construction chain. This classes job is the only one able to drive the forklift. 
Primary duties are to receive pallets of resources from incoming trucks, and reorganize the included blocks for the crane operator to pick up and deliver. 
This job focuses on personal organization and project foresight. Successful use of the Loading zone, Staging area, and Pallet zone will result in a win for this class. 

The controls for driving the forklift will be a forward and backward movement stick, as well as a wheel with a knob on it that moves by pressing the buttons to left and right. This left and right motion turns the wheel and allows users to actively back up and go forward, as well as turn like an actual forklift would. There is also a button that is for the raising and lowering of the forklift arms. Operating this vehicle will take some practice. 

## Carpenter
The carpenter is a support role that while occasionally must place framing, mainly focuses on constructing scaffolding for other players to reach higher places. This position requires good listen skills and quick movements 

## Mason
The mason is in charge of placing all stone carvings and blocks. This class relies on the crane operator heavily, as some blocks are large, and can take up an entire pallets or reqire placement by crane.

## Electrician
The electrician must place electrical wiring on each floor, which can often be in hard to reach areas. This relies heavily on the carpenter
