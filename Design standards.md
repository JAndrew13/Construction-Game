# Software

* pixel studio (mobile)

## Game engine
* Game Maker Studio 2

## Programming Languages
* GML

## File Sharing and discussion

## Sprites
Sprites should all have a similar look and feel. 
Light shading and realism is encouraged, but keeping it minimal nad clean is ideal. 

Characters should be short and stocky, but don't lean too hard onto the chibi style. They are custruction workers! 

# Design Constants
* All objects, tiles, and character sprites should be sized at 64*64 pixels 
* For background sprites larger than 1 square tile size, keep the aspect ratio the same, so not to stretch pixels
* When coloring sprites, please stick to the "ZUGHY 32" color pallet
